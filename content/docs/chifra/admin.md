## intro
The Admin section of commands allows you to get the status of the system as well as control the creation of, sharing of, and pinning of the TrueBlocks index of appearances. It also provides a mechanism for serving the `chifra` subcommands as API endpoints through the `chifra serve` command.
## chifra status

The `chifra status` program allows you to manage and explore the various TrueBlock caches. You may list all, some, or individual cache entries either as a summary or in full detail. The cache types are described in the `modes` option. There are caches for the address index, named addresses, abi files, as well as other things including blockchain data, address monitors and groups of address monitors called entities.

### usage

`Usage:`    chifra status [-d|-t|-v|-h] &lt;mode&gt; [mode...]  
`Purpose:`  Report on status of one or more TrueBlocks caches.

`Where:`  

| Hotkey | Option | Description |
| :----- | :----- | :---------- |
|  | modes | the type of status info to retrieve, one or more of *[ index \| monitors \| entities \| names \| abis \| caches \| some\* \| all ]* |
| -d | --details | include details about items found in monitors, slurps, abis, or price caches |
| -t | --types <val> | for caches mode only, which type(s) of cache to report, one or more of *[ blocks \| transactions \| traces \| slurps \| prices \| all\* ]* |
| -v | --verbose | set verbose level. Either -v, --verbose or -v:n where 'n' is level |
| -h | --help | display this help screen |

## chifra serve

`chifra serve` delivers all of the `chifra` commands, along with all of their options, as a JSON api using the GoLang program we call `flame`.


You may get help on the [API here](https://www.tokenomics.io/api.html
). Although another way to get help to simply run `chifra --help` or `chifra <cmd> --help` to see routes and all the options for each route. See below for an example of converting a command line to an API url.

### usage

`Usage:`    chifra serve  
`Purpose:`  Present each chifra command along with all of its options as a JSON api.

`Where:`  

| Short Cut | Option    | Description                                 |
| --------: | :-------- | :------------------------------------------ |
|           | --port    | specify the server's port (default ":8080") |
|        -v | --verbose | verbose level (between 0 and 10 inclusive)  |
|        -h | --help    | display this help screen                    |

`Notes:`

- To use the API, first open a new terminal window and run `chifra serve`
- Instead of the command line `chifra status index --details`, run `curl "http://localhost:8080/status?modes=index&details"`.
- Treat other commands similarly.

## chifra scrape

The `chifra scrape` app queries the rpcProvider you specify (or your local node if none) using the RPC interface reading each block from any EVM-based blockchain. After extensive optimizations to the data, including <img width=500px align="right" src="docs/image.png"> determining each transaction's error status and expanding internal message calls, the blocks are stored in a speed-optimized database for fast retrieval. By doing as much work as possible prior to storage, TrueBlocks is able to achieve significant increases in speed of retrieval over the node.

Using operating system tools such as Linux's `cron` you can easily maintain a  constantly fresh TrueBlocks database. Using TrueBlocks `display strings` technology, it is even easy to populate a regular web 2.0 database and from there a full featured website representing the full state of your smart contract.

### usage

`Usage:`    chifra scrape [-t|-n|-p|-s|-i|-R|-v|-h] mode  
`Purpose:`  Decentralized blockchain scraper and block cache.

`Where:`  

| Hotkey | Option | Description |
| :----- | :----- | :---------- |
|  | mode | control the block and account scrapers, one of *[ run \| quit \| pause \| restart ]* (required) |
| -t | --tool <val> | process the index, monitors, or both (none means process timestamps only), one or more of *[ monitors \| index\* \| none \| both ]* |
| -n | --n_blocks <num> | maximum number of blocks to process (defaults to 5000) |
| -p | --pin | pin new chunks (and blooms) to IPFS (requires Pinata key and running IPFS node) |
| -s | --sleep <double> | the number of seconds to sleep between passes (default 14) |
| -i | --cache_txs | write transactions to the cache (see notes) |
| -R | --cache_traces | write traces to the cache (see notes) |
| -v | --verbose | set verbose level. Either -v, --verbose or -v:n where 'n' is level |
| -h | --help | display this help screen |

## chifra init

`chifra list` takes one or more addresses, queries the index of appearances, and builds a TrueBlocks 'monitor'. A monitor is a file that represents your interest in those particular addresses. The first time you create a monitor takes a few minutes, but the information is cached, so subsequent queries are much faster.

Note that `chifra list` does not extract transactional data from the chain. This is accomplished with `chifra export`. In fact, `chifra list` is just a shortcut of the command `chifra export --appearances` and may be used interchangably.

### usage

`Usage:`    chifra list &lt;address&gt; [address...]  
`Purpose:`  List appearances for the given address(es).

`Where:`  

| Short Cut | Option | Description |
| -------: | :------- | :------- |
|  | addrs | one or more addresses (0x...) to export (required) |
| -v | --verbose | set verbose level. Either -v, --verbose or -v:n where 'n' is level |
| -h | --help | display this help screen |

`Notes:`

- `addresses` must start with '0x' and be forty two characters long.

## chifra pins

The `chifra pins` is not ready for prime time. Please return late.

### usage

`Usage:`    chifra pins [-c|-i|-f|-s|-v|-h]  
`Purpose:`  Report on and manage the remotely pinned appearance index and associated bloom filters.

`Where:`  

| Hotkey | Option | Description |
| :----- | :----- | :---------- |
| -c | --compare | report differences (if any) between the manifest and pinning service |
| -i | --init | initialize the local index by downloading bloom filters from the pinning service |
| -f | --freshen | freshen the manifest from the hash found at the smart contract |
| -s | --sleep <double> | the number of seconds to sleep between requests during init (default .25) |
| -v | --verbose | set verbose level. Either -v, --verbose or -v:n where 'n' is level |
| -h | --help | display this help screen |
