Ethereum as it was meant to be: local-first, P2P, and accurate queries to all the data you'll ever need.

== What even is this?

TrueBlocks creates an index that lets you access the entire Ethereum chain directly from your local machine.
It ships with a large number of tools that let you chain together queries on all types of Ethereum data:
transaction numbers, addresses, blocks, ABIs, et cetera.

Trueblocks works by capturing the chain at any point in time on an index.
Although it lets you query the entire chain, the index occupies only about 50gb of space
(for comparison, the unindexed chain occupies about six terrabytes).
We distribute the index over the link:https://ipfs.io/[Interplanetary file system], letting you avoid centralized cloud node services.

Through a binary cache, TrueBlocks can make your repeated queries _very fast_.
For large complex queries, this cache can reduce query times from minutes to seconds.

If they want privacy, speed, and data quality, TrueBlocks might be helpful to:

* Data scientists
* Investigators who want to track addresses and accounts
* Organizations like charities who may need to process restricted donations.
* Any Ethereum-head. If you have a cool idea, let us know!

=== The catch

Unfortunately, while the index is already working on some test accounts, it's not quite ready for widespread public release.
However, this repo does offer some tools that should work on any Mac or Linux machine.

== Background: Promise vs. Reality

Back in late 2015, we become obsessed with Ethereum. Not because of 'price go up', but because of the amazing promise that shared, global data has to change the world:

* Permissionless data
* World-wide consented-to data
* Cryptographically secured data
* Distributed data
* Immutable data

Sound enticing, but be honest: things haven't worked out exactly as we thought.

The reality is that there are many hard engineering problems left to solve:

* Heavy computational requirements means Ethereum nodes are difficult to run on your own
* Extracting meaningful data from the node is slow, error-prone, and confusing
* Current methods of accessing Ethereum data rely on third-party providers and APIs which will lead to:
** Privacy invasion
** Winner-take-all market dominance by a small number of (or one!) providers
** Unnecessary costs, rate-limiting, sharing of services for remote data

Moreover, using an Ethereum node -- especially a remote node -- is REALLY slow!

TrueBlocks tries to mitigate some these issues.
For the heavy computing problem, the index gives you access to the entire chain, without running a node. 
[[NO IDEA about this one â†’]]For validation, our articulation tool lets you translate the transaction bytes into human-readable data.
Accessing this index through the IPFS ensures immutability (as changing anything would change the address hash) 
The index is local-first and distributed over IPFS, ensuring decentralization.
The cache ensure its fast.

== What works now?

Until indexing works on all computers, only a few of these tools will run on your current machines.
Unfortunately, these are the tools that make queries to external APIs.
For example `chifra quotes` lets you query Eth prices.
But if you're not running a node, you'll need an RPC API key.
This is _totally beside the point_, we get it.
But if you want to give it a try, these tools are working today.

The following instructions have you compiling from source and working on the CLI.

=== Installing

. Install dependencies
+
[shell]
----
sudo apt install build-essential git cmake python python-dev libcurl3-dev clang-format jq
----

== How can I help?

We're really grateful for all commits and issues, from typos to major optimizations.

Some current items on the to-do list include:

* Coding
** [ ] [[I don't know!!]]

* Documentation
** [ ] Commands 
** [ ] explorer

If you want to make a PR, here's our preferred flow:

. Clone whichever repo you're interested in (trueblocks-core, trueblocks-docker, or trueblocks-explorer).

. Checkout the develop branch (git checkout develop).

. Create a branch from the develop branch (git checkout -b whatever).

. Create a PR against the develop branch 

. Once your PR is merged, your remote branch will be deleted (to keep the number of stale branches low)
